# COM-S-327-Repo

This repository is intended store my progress through COM S 327 at Iowa State University.

Essentially, for each assignment in the class, a folder will be created containing C files, Makefiles, READMEs, Changelogs, .tar.gz files, etc. This repository conveniently allows me to access these files across multiple platforms, namely the ISU Pyrite server and my personal Windows machine.

Assignment 0 was placed in a separate repository, but this seems like a better solution.
