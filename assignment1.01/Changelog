Today I created the Makefile and initial C file for the assignment.

I have now created:

An enum "terrain" to maintain the different terrain features which can be
found on the map.

A struct "point" which holds an x coordinate, a y coordinate, and a terrain
type.

My main starts by creating an 80 x 21 array of terrains. It populates the
edges with "wall"s and the spaces in the middle with "empty".

The main method also generates exits on each of the four edges of the map
(randomly), and gives those locations in the array the "door" property.

A print method was included to display the map.

I begun work on using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find a path between two exits.
