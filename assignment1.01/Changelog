Today I created the Makefile and initial C file for the assignment.

I have now created:

An enum "terrain" to maintain the different terrain features which can be
found on the map.

A struct "point" which holds an x coordinate, a y coordinate, and a terrain
type.

My main starts by creating an 80 x 21 array of terrains. It populates the
edges with "wall"s and the spaces in the middle with "empty".

The main method also generates exits on each of the four edges of the map
(randomly), and gives those locations in the array the "door" property.

A print method was included to display the map.

I begun work on using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find a path between two exits.

Continuing work on Dijkstra's Algorithm, trying to make my implementation more
efficient.

Through extensive testing, the algorithm is sufficient, although there are
some unexplained edge cases that required specific patching.

Added an additional central point "intersection" whose coordinates are
determined randomly. Each exit simply connects to the intersection.

Tightened the screws on path finding, and generated a random biome for each
quadrant created by the paths.

Finished biome population. Basically, each quadrant is assigned a biome, and
in some cases some empty space remains.

To get around this, we also populate each empty space with a randomly selected
biome. This also makes the map feel more natural.

Also, added different colored characters to give the map a more natural feel.

Added Center and Mart generation. The program is now "complete."

There are a few edge cases which I still need to fix.

Looked more closely at the assignment spec to see if I could meet the
criteria. There were really only a couple of stylistic changes I needed to
make:

Make walls boulders (%)
Generate tall grass and clearings
Make Centers and Marts 2x2

I also fixed the edge cases which made Mart and Center generation difficult.

I'm not sure how large the clearings are supposed to be, so for now I'm
leaving it as it is, and possibly changing it after class on Tuesday.

This is essentially finished.
